# India Energy Stack (IES)
**Official Repository of the India Energy Stack**

The **India Energy Stack (IES)** is a national-scale digital architecture designed to enable secure, interoperable, and real-time data exchange across India’s power sector. Inspired by India’s Digital Public Infrastructure initiatives, IES provides a uniform technical foundation that accelerates innovation, strengthens grid reliability, and supports new market and operational models.

This repository serves as the **central home for specifications, reference implementations, documentation, and standards** developed under the IES Initiative.

The v0.1 release introduces the foundational architecture documents and accompanying specifications, with complete coverage for two initial use cases: EV Charging and Peer-to-Peer Energy Trading.
